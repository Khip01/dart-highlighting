# flutter_highlighting

**This repository is currently a work in progress. Please follow us and check back later.**

We aim to port the [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) project into Dart.

This package adds a Flutter widget and themes to the core
[highlighting](https://pub.dev/packages/highlighting) package.
You most likely want its README.
